# Spatial-Filtering-2DConvolution
In this project I implemented 2D convolution function using MATLAB and applied it on some images using different kernels. <br/>
This project is the final project of my Signals & Systems course at Shahid Beheshti University (Fall 2021) instructed by Dr. Armin Salimi-Badr
